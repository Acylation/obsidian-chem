# Obsidian Chem

**Chem** is a plugin for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) providing chemistry support. It allows you to insert chemical structures into your notes through code blocks containing SMILES strings (powered by [Smiles Drawer](https://github.com/reymond-group/smilesDrawer)).

## Features & Usage

### Render SMILES strings as chemical structures

You can use this plugin to render chemical structures from SMILES strings. Just type the SMILES strings in a code block with `smiles` as the language. Each line should have only one string.

The data is stored as plain text, so you won‚Äôt lose it. The renderer will always work, even if the plugin changes its cheminfo core.

You can adjust the image size and configure light themes and dark themes of the molecule pictures in the plugin‚Äôs settings page.

> **Notice**  
> For now, you need to refresh the file containing SMILES blocks, or refresh the blocks themselves by edit & quit the blocks to apply the new settings, as well as adapting the Obsidian light/dark theme changes.

#### What is SMILES?

SMILES stands for Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System. It is a specification to describe chemical structures using linear ASCII strings. You can learn more about SMILES from the [official website](http://opensmiles.org/opensmiles.html) or [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system).

#### Why using SMILES?

Using SMILES strings to represent molecules is easier and more widely supported by chemistry drawing tools than using LaTeX packages like mhchem and chemfig.

#### How to generate SMILES strings?

 For simple structures, you can type them in by yourself, but for more complex ones, you may want to use structure editors, such as ChemDraw, [ChemDrawJS](https://chemdrawdirect.perkinelmer.cloud/js/sample/index.html#), [MarvinJS](https://marvinjs-demo.chemaxon.com/latest/index.html) and [Ketcher](https://lifescience.opensource.epam.com/KetcherDemoSA/index.html).

## Installation

The plugin is not available in the official plugin market for now. Please follow the steps below to install it manually.

1. Go to the repo's latest [release page](https://github.com/Acylation/obsidian-chem/releases), and download the `main.js`, `style.css`, and `manifest.json`. Alternatively, you can download the latest zip file and then unzip it to get the three files.

2. Copy these files to your local path `[yourvault]/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-chem/`. You may need to create the folder `obsidian-chem` by yourself.

3. Launch/restart Obsidian, or refresh the plugin list, you will see this plugin. (Make sure that you are not in restricted mode).

4. In the plugin list, enable `Chem` and enjoy!

## Plugin Scope

I have a lot of ideas for this plugin, but my coding skills and resources are limited. I want to make it useful for anyone who needs to take notes on chemistry (such as research records, organic chemistry anki cards, etc.). As examples, here are some of the features I have in mind.

- Displaying chemical formulas and structures.
- Importing structures from the clipboard, .cdxml files, etc.
- Appending chemical info (e.g. exact mass) next to the structures. This can help MS users and beginners in chemistry.
- Supporting internal coordinates like .mol files. Would be useful in computational chemistry.
- Shortcuts for physicochemical formulas in LaTeX.
- ......

I would love to hear your feedback and suggestions. Actually, the first feature of the plugin, to render SMILES strings, was suggested by community users! I‚Äôm very grateful for their input. (See the [acknowledgment](https://github.com/Acylation/obsidian-chem#acknowledgment) section for more details)

Before working on a new feature, I will consider the following criteria. The feature should meet at least one of them to be useful.

- It helps with taking notes on chemical research, like experimental records, literature notes, paper writing, etc.
- It promotes a workflow that integrates well with other chemistry tools.
- It aids in learning chemistry and related subjects.

## Acknowledgement

The plugin relies on [Smiles Drawer](https://github.com/reymond-group/smilesDrawer) as the parsing and drawing core, and uses [Mathpix](https://github.com/Mathpix/mathpix-markdown-it) as an example of how to integrate the package.

During the whole process of development, I found the [developer documentation](https://docs.obsidian.md/Plugins/Getting+started/Build+a+plugin) super helpful. Massive thanks to @marcusolssonfor leading this project!

The plugin is motivated by forum requests for including chemical structures in Obsidian. Thank you for the inspiration and great ideas!
